## Introduction
This project aims to build a deep learning model to automatically generate metadata (captions) for videos. It leverages LSTM for sequence modeling and incorporates self-attention to improve the quality of the generated captions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the TMDB Movie Metadata and The Movies Dataset from Kaggle, which includes video frames and corresponding captions.

## Model Architecture
The model consists of the following components:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors.
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures sequential dependencies in the input data.
- **Self-Attention Layer**: Focuses on different parts of the input sequence.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: Produces the final output.

## Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss. The training involves:
- Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
- Training the model for a defined number of epochs.
- Monitoring loss and accuracy to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using loss and accuracy plots. Generated captions are compared with actual captions to assess quality.

## Results
The model generates captions for video frames with reasonable accuracy. Examples of generated captions and corresponding video frames are provided in the results section.
